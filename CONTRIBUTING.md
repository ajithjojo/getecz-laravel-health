- Confirm the issue is related to this package (not Laravel core)

### When reporting an issue, include:
- Laravel version
- PHP version
- Package version or branch
- Environment (local / shared hosting / VPS)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots or logs (if applicable)

Incomplete issues may be closed without review.

## ✨ Feature Requests

Feature ideas are welcome, but keep them **focused and practical**.

Please explain:
- The problem you’re trying to solve
- Why existing features don’t cover it
- Whether this is shared-hosting friendly

Large or breaking changes should be discussed in an issue before any code is written.
